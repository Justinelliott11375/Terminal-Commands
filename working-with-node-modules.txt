Exercises

2. What JavaScript statement do you use to export a module?

Online Research Questions

1. Are there other ways to export a module?

ES6 allows for module exports to be declared in the same block of code they are defined with the keyword 'export', ex:
    export function foo() {};

2. What are ES6 modules and how do they differ from the module we created in this checkpoint?

In addition to the 'import' and 'export' keywords, importing modules happens asynchronously, file contents are parsed as soon as they are available.

Code Challenge

1. Create a Github repository called Terminal Command and add the code from this checkpoint. Implement the touch and mkdir commands to the terminal-commands module:

terminal-commands.js
const fs = require('fs')

module.exports.ls = () => {
  fs.readdir('./', (err, files) => {
    const filesToString = files.reduce((acc, file) => {
      return `${acc} ${file} `;
    }, '');

    console.log(filesToString);
  });
};

module.exports.touch = () => {
  // your code here
};

module.exports.mkdir = () => {
  // your code here
};
